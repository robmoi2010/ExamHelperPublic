# ExamHelperPublic
Java project for cheating on online tests. It can run in the background without generating visible on-screen logs. Useful for tests that capture screen.
### How it works
- It captures selected screen area(exam question area). Using mouse clicks it draws an invisible rectangle around a question.
- The question screenshot is passed through an OCR to capture text from image.
- The captured text is passed through a text formatter to format the text.
- The formatted text is then sent to a default configured AI to generate the answer.
- The generated answer is passed through a text formatter to format the answer.
- The formatted text is then sent to a text-to-speech to dictate the answer to the listener.
  Can be configured to print answers to the console instead of dictating in cases where the exam does not capture the user screen.

NB: The quality of the answers is dictated by the AI that is used. Can be configured to use various AI's to generate answers.
